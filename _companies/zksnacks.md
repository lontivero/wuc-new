zkSNACKs Ltd. was established to research the possibilities for Bitcoin fungibility
enhancements and provide different products ensuring the desired privacy.

[Many believes that Bitcoin is anonymous](https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy),
but in reality the Blockchain is transparent.
Our mission is to equip our users with powerful tools to secure their financial
privacy. zkSNACKs is therefore developing and providing a non-custodial desktop
wallet for its users which provides enhanced privacy through CoinJoin.
